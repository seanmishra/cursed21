in the chest before you can carry more.

## Story

Keeping in sight the theme for this #GGJ2019, **Cursed 21** is the story of a
man who stole 21 pieces of cursed coins from an ancient chest in a mysterious island
during his travels. However, as time passed by, he lost his human form and was
turned into a beast as a punishment for stealing the coins. In his desperation, he
threw the coins away and tried to go back home to his beloved. But his beloved
didn't recognize him in his beast form.

He then decided to return to the mysterious island and collect the coins scattered
all across it the hope that putting them back in the chest would lift the curse.
